### Added

* Add `excludeFromNavigation` property to all the layout allowing to opt-out a page from the Next / Previous button generation
* Recompute the known pages if the attributes of a page change.

This ensure that the information using the attributes like the menu or the next / previous buttons are up to date on all the page

* Add copy button to code blocks
* Add `$textual-steps-color` color SCSS variable
* Create a NuGet package `Nacara.Core` which shares the type and some helpers between Nacara and the layouts project
* Add section support, a section is defined by being a folder under the root folder

    For example, this structure defined 2 sections.

    ```
    docsrc
    ├── changelogs
    │   ├── file.md
    ├── docs
    │   ├── file.md
    ├── index.md
    ```

* Make the layout as a standalone npm package `nacara-layout-standard`
* Move the `Changelog.fs` from `Nacara` to the `Layout` project and rename it `ChangelogParser.fs`
* Upgrade to Fable 3

    Change `Model.DocFiles` to use `JS.Map` instead of `Map` because it seems like Fable 3 does something different and break the `Map` usage from the layout project

* Remove the material like button
* Unknown files are now copied to the output folder making it easier to add static assets like images
* Generate compressed CSS from SCSS/SASS files when in build mode
* Rewrite the base-url-middleware to redirect on exact match and use temporary redirection to avoid caching from the browser
* Rewrite the base-url-middleware to redirect on exact match and use temporary redirection to avoid caching from the browser
* Changed `version` in `paket.dependencies` to `5.258.1` so that it matches the version in `.config/dotnet-tools.json`. This fixes the issue which required having .NET DSK version `'2.1.0`.
* Use paket from CLI tool

### Fixed

* Changelog parser and layout now correctly understand items indeed under a list item

    Before, this text would have been displayed as quoted or you would have had to un-indent to force Nacara to display it "correctly" in the browser.

### Removed

* Removed files `fake.cmd` and `fake.sh` because they are no longer needed.
* Removed unused code from `build.fsx`.
* Remove fake and use a Makefile instead.
* Remove plugins property from the config file. Now the layouts can extends their own version of markdown-it to meet their needs
* Remove the `menu` property from the config file

Right now Windows user needs to install make or use Gitpod. In the future, a `make.bat` will be available but I don't have time to add it right now.



## 0.4.1 - 2021-05-10

### Fixed

* When Nacara encounter an unknown file in build mode skip it and trigger the next process.

It was stopping the whole generation causing problem is the user hosted some PNG files in the source folder for example.

* Change the font-size to `16px` to improve readibility and accessibility


## 0.4.0 - 2021-05-02

### Changed

* Change the config file name from `nacara.js` is now `nacara.config.js`

    It seems like the new version of `npm exec` and `npx` execute/open `nacara.js` when executing `npx nacara`. Probably because the file as the same name as the package 🤷‍♂️

        ]
    }
    ```

                    mdMessage("warning")
                ]
            },
            {
                path: path.join(__dirname, './src/markdown-it-anchored.js')
